Social Media Sentiment Intelligence Dashboard
Project Overview

The Social Media Sentiment Intelligence Dashboard is an end to end analytics project designed to understand public opinion expressed on social media platforms. The project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from large volumes of unstructured text data collected from Twitter and Reddit. By using natural language processing, machine learning, structured data storage, and interactive visualization, the system transforms raw social media content into clear and actionable sentiment insights.

This project demonstrates how data engineering, data science, and business intelligence tools can work together to support data driven decision making.
